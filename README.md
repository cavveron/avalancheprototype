Project Overview

The mobile-first Avalanche Bingsu web prototype provides a responsive design which enables users to easily place orders for their own Korean shaved ice dessert creations. The project aimed to transform complicated product customization choices (flavor selection and topping options) into a straightforward visual sequence which users could follow.

Key Features

The design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to create fully responsive layouts which adapt to mobile devices and desktop computers with multiple columns through media query implementation.

The Visual Pathway follows a direct sequence which starts at Home before users select their flavors and customize toppings before they proceed to the Cart/Checkout section.

The website uses Semantic HTML elements which include <main> and <article> and <nav> and <header> and <footer> elements together with high-contrast typography from Google Fonts (Poppins & Open Sans).

The system includes basic alerts which help the shopping process and button functions which enable users to navigate between pages.

Folder Structure

The index.html file contains a landing page which displays a hero banner together with a preview of the menu.

The flavorpg.html page uses a grid system which enables users to pick their preferred base flavors.

toppingspg.html: The selection interface for toppings includes a responsive sticky cart summary which stays in place.

The final checkout form with date/time and payment input fields exists in cartpg.html.

about.html: Information about the brand, mission, and team.

The main stylesheet which contains all variables and layout rules and typography and media queries exists at /css/styles.css.

The project contains its images in the /imgs/ directory which uses optimized .avif and .jpg file formats.

The project PDFs which include Research and Sketches and Visual Identity and Peer Reviews are stored in the /documentation/ directory.
